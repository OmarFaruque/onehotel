========== Plugin Name =============
A user friendly plugin that automatically creates a order list specific index or table of contents which tag or class you want (TOC) for long pages (and custom post types). More than just a table of contents plugin.

the table of contents by default appears where you want on a page via using shortcode. This allows the author to insert lead-in content that may summarise or introduce the rest of the page. 

This plugin is a great companion for content rich sites such as content management system oriented configurations. That said, bloggers also have the same benefits when writing long structured articles. Discover how Google uses this index to provide 'Jump To' links to your content.

Custom post types are supported, however, auto insertion works only when the_content() has been used by the custom post type.
